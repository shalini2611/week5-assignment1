    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exception occurs, Python generates an object that represents the error, which can then be handled by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions in Python can be caused by a variety of factors, such as dividing by zero, referencing a non-existent variable, or opening a file that doesn't exist. Some common exceptions in Python include TypeError, ValueError, and IOError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand the code that has been written. Syntax errors are usually caused by spelling mistakes, missing punctuation, or incorrect use of Python syntax. Unlike exceptions, which occur during the execution of the program, syntax errors prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed. Exceptions can be handled with try-except blocks, which allow the program to continue running despite the error, while syntax errors must be fixed before the program can be executed."
